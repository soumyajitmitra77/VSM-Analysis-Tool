# VSM-Analysis-Tool

This repository contains code to perform a value stream mapping (VSM) analysis of the impacts of rising prosumers on stakeholders in the energy industry. However, this VSM tool can be applied to assess the impacts of other changes or scenarios in energy systems as well.

It implements the methodology proposed in the paper "Value Stream Mapping of Stakeholder Impacts from Rising Prosumers":

## Description

The emergence of distributed energy resources like solar PV and batteries enables consumers to become prosumers - both producing and consuming electricity. However, the impacts of rising prosumerism on industry stakeholders have not been well studied.

The methodology is as follows:

This code implements a generalizable VSM methodology to quantify the economic impacts of changes in the energy system on key stakeholders. It can compare an existing base case to alternative future scenarios.
